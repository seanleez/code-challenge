# 1. Issues Found: (Original Version)

## Type Safety Issues

- Blockchain parameter in `getPriority` is typed as any
- Missing proper interface for the balance object that includes `blockchain` property
- Inconsistent use of `WalletBalance` vs `FormattedWalletBalance` in the code

## Logic Errors

- The filter logic is incorrect and uses undefined variable `lhsPriority`
- The filter condition returns `true` for zero/negative balances and `false` for positive ones
- The sort comparison is incomplete (doesn't handle equal priorities)

## Performance Issues

- `getPriority` is recreated on every render
- `prices` dependency is missing from `useMemo` but used in formatted `rows`
- Unnecessary double iteration (first `sortedBalances.map` then another map for rows)

## React Best Practices

- Using array index as key in mapped components
- Unused `children` prop destructuring
- Inline styles/classes without proper typing



# 2. Improvements Explained: (Refactored Version)

## Type Safety

- Added proper typing for blockchain names using union types
- Created a proper interface hierarchy for wallet balances
- Removed any types

## Performance Optimizations

- Moved `getPriority` outside component scope for common usage
- Combined multiple array operations into a single chain in `useMemo`
- Added proper dependencies to `useMemo`

## Logic Improvements

- Fixed filter logic to properly handle positive balances
- Simplified sort comparison using numerical subtraction
- Moved USD value calculation into the memoized chain

## React Best Practices

- Added proper unique keys using blockchain and currency
- Removed unused prop destructuring
- Moved types and constants outside component
- Used proper TypeScript features for type safety

## Code Organization

- Grouped related interfaces together
- Used consistent naming conventions
- Improved code readability with proper typing
- Separated concerns (types, constants, component logic)

This refactored version is more performant, type-safe, and follows React best practices while maintaining the same functionality.
